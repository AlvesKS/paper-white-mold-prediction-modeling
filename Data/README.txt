The data sources were scattered across different project folders, so I just copied them to this one place.
The code in the `AlvesPipeline` project will access the data files in this `Data` folder.

data_model_plus_weather_filtered.csv
- this file contains the observational data (wm presence/absence) for each field linked to weather time series that were processed by Kaique Alves (ERA5-Land plus downscaling).

extracted_soil_data.csv
- also prepared by Kaique Alves, soils variable for each of the field sites

Survey.RData
- a cleaned version of the observational field survey data. This was the same dataset used in the earlier paper we published on this survey data (Plant Pathology 2019)
