## Summary

We developed a workflow for enhancing small observational datasets to model plant disease risk. Using white mold in snap beans as a case study, we fused georeferenced disease observations with soil variables and features from downscaled weather data. Functional data analysis identified key periods in the weather series, and random forests highlighted critical predictors, which were used to build a simpler logistic regression model. This approach demonstrates how machine learning can guide the development of calibrated, practical models, addressing overfitting and aligning analytical complexity with dataset size.
